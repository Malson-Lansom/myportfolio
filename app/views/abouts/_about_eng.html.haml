            %p.color-facebookblack I was strognly attracted that programming is very powerful and being able to update my works and myself. There were someone and family who tried to hold me back because of my age and because of the fact that we had very different backgrounds, but I still have more or equal to 30 years of life left. So I decided to do everything, to give whole mybody to make this decision to best for my perspective.
